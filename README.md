# Weather-app
A simple weather app to get the current weather and 5 day forcast

There is a GUI version and CLI available.

Requests are made from the api found here: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast
and here: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather


IMPORTANT:

You will need to sign up to openweathermap (which is free) and sub to the current weather and 5-day forcast (both free)
Then put in your own API key in the key variable. (line #106 in the GUI and #64 in the CLI)
